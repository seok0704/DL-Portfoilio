# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purposes. 

## Contents
### Recommender System
* [League of Legends Recommender System](https://github.com/seok0704/lol-recsys): This project builds a League of legends recommender system using Python and collaborative filtering for the game of League of Legends. Web scraping is used for collection of data. The implemented recommender system is then deployed into web application using DJango.

_Tools Used: Visual Studio, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, RIOT API, Django, Bootstrap, Numpy_

* [Movie Lens Recommender System](https://github.com/seok0704/lol-recsys): The project uses a dataset called MovieLens, which contains movie ratings per user. The project explores various methods such as User Average, Popularity, Collaborative Filtering and PMF with different metric system such as P@k, R@K, and RMSE for implementation of the recommender system.


### Regression / Classification Model
* [Salary Classification of Data Scientist](https://github.com/seok0704/Salary-Classification): The goal of this project is to gain insights into career paths that could get you a high salary in the fied of data science using 2018 Kaggle ML & DS survey data. Supervised machine learning algorithm is used to make a prediction on the prediction on which salary bracket a person belongs to depending on their survey answers they have provided.

* [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/seok0704/fake-news-datacup): The NLP project submission to a DataCup Competition "Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News" is based on "Leaders Prize: Fact or Fake News" Competition (http://leadersprize.truenorthwaterloo.com). The goal of this competition is to develop a classification model that automate the fact-checking process and flag whether a claim is true, partly true or false. The model uses Naive Bayes and have placed top 22nd in the competition.

* [Federal Election 2019](https://github.com/seok0704/federal-election-2019): The NLP project to determine the sentiment of different parties and gain insights about 2019 Canadian election using Tweets data.

* [Reddit Sentiment Analysis & Classification of Subreddit](https://github.com/seok0704/DL-Portfoilio/blob/main/Reddit%20NLP%20Project.ipynb): The NLP project aims to build a model that classifies the subreddit using the post data from reddit. Additionally, the project dives into the sentiment analysis of the post title, using Vader Analyzer.

_Tools Used: scikit-learn, numpy, NLTK, seaborn, XGBoost, Keras_

### Other Projects
* [Information Retreival Project](https://github.com/seok0704/JC-Portfoilio/blob/main/ir_assignment.ipynb): This project uses 4000 documents from US Government websites and the topics are 15 needs for government information. The aim of this project is to utilize Whoosh (Python Search Engine Library) on large pool of documents and validate on its baseline model.

_Tools Used: Whoosh, pytrec val, NLTK_
